Algorithm for finding words

Loading patients
Each excel file remove all new lines, and replace all "," with special character, this ensures when 
it is changed to a csv each line represents a single line from the excel sheet

Use Excel class to creat an object that contains data on the headers in the file and each subject
in the file.

Subjects
Each Subject object contains a list where each item in list is a string corresponding to information
from a single cell in the subjects excel file.

Checking for words
Given a single entry for  a subject
1. run check pattern - this will check for patterns that are dependent on punctuation
and aren't allowed such as dates. if a pattern is found, replace that part of the string 
with -redacted-(some version that fits)
2. run check for words - this will first remove all left over punctuation, and then check for
any items that are known words or numbers
3. if anything is leftover after this pass, it will be labeled as indeterminate. The only things that 
should be left over at this point are mispelled words, and words that must be manually looked at
such as abbreviations.
