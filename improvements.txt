Process improvements
====================================================
Currently only looks for proper names and Dates as PHI
add ability to find: addresses , phone numbers
add ability to better distinguish if a word is a name based on: position in sentence, ,capitilization


UI improvements
====================================================
Make sessions that persist so that when deidentifying large number of files you can choose to deidentify
a group of them, then return and run the process again, benefitting from a dictionary that has been
created from a subset of files. Hopefully the dictionary will 'learn' which ambigious words to allow
through and which to remove from the file.

Make it easier to select words, only show ten at a time so when the user selects from those ten, an new group pops up, reduces need to scroll.

Find a nice way to present a large amount of words on the screen , where user can easily use mouse to categorize fast.

Fun
=====================================================
make a graphic that shows each cell as it's being de-identifed, gives the user something to look at,
like a fun loading bar.
